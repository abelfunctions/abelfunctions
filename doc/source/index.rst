Abelfunctions is a library for computing with Abelian functions, Riemann
surfaces, and algebraic curves. If you are new to Abelfunctions, begin with the
:doc:`getting_started` guide. More tutorials, application areas, and complete
software reference is presented in the documentation below.

.. note::

   Abelfunctions was recently rewritten to use Sage instead of Sympy for
   symbolic calculations. As a result, some of the documentation may be out of
   data. Please be patient as we (Chris) update the documentation to reflect
   these changes.
