r"""Differentials :mod:`abelfunctions.differentials`
================================================

This module contains functions for computing a basis of holomorphic
differentials of a Riemann surface given by a complex plane algebraic curve
:math:`f \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]`. A differential :math:`\omega = h(x,y)dx` defined
on a Riemann surface :math:`X` is holomorphic on :math:`X` if it is holomorphic
at every point on :math:`X`.

The function :func:`differentials` computes the basis of holomorphic
differentials from an input algebraic curve :math:`f = f(x,y)`. The
differentials themselves are encapsulated in a :class:`Differential` Cython
class.
