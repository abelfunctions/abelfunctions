class ComplexPathFactory(object):
    r"""Factory for computing complex paths on the x-projection of a Riemann surface
    determined by an algebraic curve :math:`C : f(x,y) = 0`.

    Since paths on a Riemann surface are computed via analytic continuation
    care needs to be taken when the x-part of the path gets close to a
    discriminant point of the algebraic curve from which the Riemann surface is
    derived. This is because some of the y-sheets of the curve, when considered
    as a covering of the complex x-plane, coalesce at the discriminant points.
    Therefore, "bounding circles" need to be computed at each discriminant
    point.

    Attributes
    ----------
    riemann_surface : RiemannSurface
        The Riemann surface on which to construct the x-paths.
    base_point : complex
        If a base point isn't provided, one will be chosen.
    kappa : double (default: 3/5)
        A scaling factor between 0.5 and 1.0 used to modify the radius
        of the bounding circles.
    discriminant_points
        The discriminant points of the curve.
    discriminant_points_complex
        Floating point approximations of the discriminant points. Used for
        computational efficiency since converting from QQbar to CDF is slow
